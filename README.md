# dotfiles

Kyle Finley's dotfiles, managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

Install them with:

```console
chezmoi init ITProKyle
```

Once completed, you may need to logout then back in for all changes to take effect as some things are setup in [`.zprofile`](./src/dot_zprofile).
This will always be the case for new initializations but only some updates.
